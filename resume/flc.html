    <h1>About the Freshman Leadership Council</h1><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2OuTsrRteFE" frameborder="0" height="400"></iframe></div><p>The Freshman Leadership Council is an executive agency of the University of Florida Student Government. The council is comprised of around 50 freshman leaders selected every year to create programs benefitting the University of Florida and Gainesville community. Council members undergo a yearlong personal and professional development curriculum designed to shape them into the future leaders of the university.<p>
    <h1><a href="#" onclick="showHideDiv('div-1')"><img src="images/flcdiv1.jpg"/></a></h1>
    <div id="div-1" style="display:none;"><p>The Freshman Leadership Council was founded in 2003 by Student Body Vice President Kate Honey in hopes of actively engaging freshmen in campus activities. During its early years, the organization focused on the personal development of its members rather than community outreach. Slowly, the council evolved into a group of civic engaged campus representatives who worked toward the improvement of the UF and Gainesville community, according to current Chairwoman <a href="https://twitter.com/alyssamarisa" target="_blank">Alyssa Nieves.</a></p>

<h2>Debate</h2>

<p>The council became known for planning an unbiased Student Government debate every spring semester in which candidates for the executive ticket discuss issues relevant to students. This debate became especially important as the UF Student Government gained a reputation for being run on <a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_c7b6155c-8dcc-11e1-b250-001a4bcf887a.html" target="_blank">a patronage system. </a></p>
    <p>Now in its ninth year, the Student Government Debate continues to uphold its standard of professionalism and non-partisanship.  <a href="https://twitter.com/brycefreeman" target="_blank">Bryce Freeman,</a> former FLC special events director, believes that this event is crucial to campus life because “it allows students to make an informed decision about which party will control the nearly $17 million Student Government budget.” </p>

<h2>Overcoming the elitist perception</h2>

<p>”One of the main challenges to FLC since its inception is that it only
caters to 50 freshmen,“ said <a href="https://twitter.com/DMorgan32" target="_blank">Demetri Morgan,</a> former FLC director.</p>
        <p>In 2010, the organization sought to expand by creating an outreach arm of the organization catering to all of the University of Florida freshmen and called the Freshman Leadership Outreach. Both FLC and FLO were now under the umbrella of the Freshman Leadership Foundation.</p><p>This change came in “efforts to develop not only those in the council but every single freshman that wants to have their leadership skills developed,” said Morgan, who was also one of the Freshman Leadership Foundation founders. “The blueprint for the new organization and strategic plan was well-researched, cross-referenced with peer institutions with similar FLC programs and passed with flying colors a trial period mandated by Student Government administration.”</p>
<p>Not even a year after its re-organization, the Freshman Leadership Council faced the ax, as a <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20110329/ARTICLES/110329361/0/search?p=1&tc=pg" target="_blank">Gainesville Sun article</a> phrased it. A cabinet restructuring act drafted by then president-elect Ben Meyers threatened to write the Freshman Leadership Council off the codes. The organization, however, emerged successful with the support of future student body presidents TJ Villamil and Christina Bonarrigo, who backed an amendment to the act that explicitly allowed for the existence of the Freshman Leadership Council.</p>
<h2> Becoming an Agency</h2>
<p>As the years passed, FLC became known as the best-performing cabinet in student government, said Morgan. “On top of developing leaders with integrity and the pertinent skill sets to be effective in roles after their freshman year, FLC consistently outperformed any other SG entity except maybe for <a href="http://www.sg.ufl.edu/SGP">SGP</a> and <a href="http://www.sg.ufl.edu/accent" target="_blank">ACCENT.</a>”</p>

<p>In 2009, Morgan, after conceiving the idea of the Freshman Leadership Foundation, which would house FLC and its outreach arm, FLO, began considering making FLF an executive agency.</p>

<p>The status of an agency would allow an organization to fundraise for itself, something that cabinets are not allowed to do, said <a href="https://twitter.com/big_drexx" target="_blank">Drexel Forbes</a>, former Budget and Appropriations committee senator. Becoming an agency would allow FLC to put on bigger and better programs and have access to a larger, individual budget.</p>

<p>In 2012, after a revision that would move the outreach portion of FLF permanently to cabinet and make FLC an independent entity, the executive branch approved the organization’s status as an agency, pending legislative approval after a one-year trial period.</p>

<p>Finally, during the summer of 2013, student senate approved <a href=”http://www.sg.ufl.edu/archivedbills/Bills/2013/2013-1030%20Addition%20of%20Chapter%20573%20-%20Freshman%20Leadership%20Council,%20to%20the%20500%20Codes.pdf” target=”_blank”> law 2013-107,</a> adding the Freshman Leadership Council as an agency. “This bill is significant because it gives this organization autonomy,” said Forbes, who was also one of the bill’s sponsors. “FLC has been tampered with in the past - both in structure and in budget, but now that it’s an agency, FLC can run itself.”</p>

<p>The creation of an agency allowed FLC to develop its programing efforts. “We’ve been able to think bigger as an agency,” said Nieves, the council’s chairwoman. “Our directors have been inspired to reach for the stars in their programing efforts, and we’ve done some exciting things.”</p></div>
